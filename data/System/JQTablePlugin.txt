%TOC%

This plugin does two things:
   1 If !TablePlugin is enabled, it enhances !TablePlugin with client-side column sorting (if Javascript is enabled)
   1 If !TablePlugin is _not_ enabled, it performs the same processing as !TablePlugin except it does it in the browser.

Some notable omissions:
   * Sorting of date fields doesn't work correctly.  (Sorts as plain text)

*when used without !TablePlugin*
   * No sort icon in table headers (just click the header to sort).
   * Sorting can be a bit strange when rowspans and colspans are used.
   * The sorted data background doesn't alternate if more than one colour is given.
   * The way column and row spans are calculated is slightly different to !TablePlugin, which may give slightly different visual effect sin some extreme cases.

*when used with !TablePlugin:*
   * Sorted column background doesn't work

You can help improve it, please feel free to do so.

Sorting is done using the jQuery tablesorter plugin written by Christian Bach,
which is included.

---++ Usage

If used with !TablePlugin: Click on column headers to sort.

If used without !TablePlugin: Behaviour should be identical to !TablePlugin.
See TablePlugin for more information.

%X% You cannot use the %<nop>CARET% and/or &<nop>#94; characters to 'escape' a rowspan in a table with JQTablePlugin (the !TablePlugin support is a dirty hack). To insert these characters, simply enclose them in a span e.g. =&lt;span>^&lt;/span>=.

%X% If !TablePlugin is used with !JQTablePlugin, then tables will be shown with
active links in column headers, as well as the icons that support in-browser
sorting. Clicking on these links will cause the table plugin to sort the table
by re-rendering the page - defeating the object of the !JQTablePlugin. To
avoid this sort of confusion you are recommended to disable the !TablePlugin.
